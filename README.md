# Search Mastodon tools

You can search tools/API uses for Mastodon.

## Add your tool

Just pull request the `database.xml` file with your tool added or leave an issue and someone will add your tool to the database. You don't need to be the owner of the tool to add it, I guess…

We use [ForkAwesome](https://forkawesome.github.io/Fork-Awesome/) for the icons!
